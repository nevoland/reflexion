# Reflexion

ðŸ’Ž React component to build layouts based on the CSS Flexbox model.

### Features

- Provides a simple abstraction of the CSS Flexbox model
- Follows the Figma auto-layout model with similar properties
- Sets all necessary Flexbox parameters to enable scrolling

## Usage

The component is exported from the main entry-point through an ES6 module:

```js
import { Flex } from "reflexion";
```

The `Flex` component uses CSS definitions that must be imported in order to work appropriately:

```css
@import "reflexion/dist/main.css";
```

> [!NOTE]
> The CSS definitions use the `:has` pseudo-class, which is not supported on FireFox. To bypass this limitation, when using FireFox, `Flex` introspects its children with JavaScript code, which can have a slight performance impact.

### Quick start

```tsx
import { Flex } from "reflexion";

function Main() {
  return (
    <Flex width="fill" height="fill">
      <Flex direction="vertical" gap={8}>
        <Flex>Toolbar</Flex>
        <Flex direction="vertical" height="fill" scroll>
          Main view
        </Flex>
        <Flex>Footer</Flex>
      </Flex>
    </Flex>
  );
}
```
